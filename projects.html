				<h3>
					ATLS 1100: Design Foundations || Spotify Mockup

				</h3>

				<p>
					This assignment was to create an app using Adobe XD. For this project our team added an emotion tracking feature to Spotify. This would allow the app to serve as a semi-diary in addition to a music streaming platform. We recreated the visual Spotify user interface in Adobe XD to emulate the app with added features.
